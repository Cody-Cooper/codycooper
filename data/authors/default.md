Hey! My name is Cody Cooper and I'm currently a Cyber Mission Specalist. I used to be a full-stack developer, but now I use my skills to protect our nation from cyber threats. I love to lead from the front, and enjoy working with people who share my passion for problem-solving and learning. Hopefully you are able to learn something from my posts! I'd love to hear any suggestions or feedback you have for my website, posts, or whatever else you've got for me.
